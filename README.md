# Function graphing FPGA

Team project developed on FPGA using VHDL: Function graphing. Comments, report and user guide are in Spanish.

This project was done during a university course (Technology and organization of computer systems) and finished in March 2014.

Xilinx ISE was employed to write the VHDL files and to synthesize the corresponding project.bit, which can be directly transferred to a suitable FPGA in order to operate the system. GuiaUtilizacion.pdf contains a brief description of what our hardware does and how it is used. DocumentoProyecto.pdf contains the technical details of the project.

You can see a video of how the project works here:

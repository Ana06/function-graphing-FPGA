# Function graphing FPGA

Team project developed on FPGA using VHDL: Function graphing. This project was done during a university course (Technology and organization of computer systems) and finished in March 2014. Comments, report and user guide are in Spanish.

Xilinx ISE was employed to write the VHDL files and to synthesize the corresponding project.bit, which can be directly transferred to a suitable FPGA in order to operate the system. GuiaUtilizacion.pdf contains a brief description of what our hardware does and how it is used. DocumentoProyecto.pdf contains the technical details of the project.

## Authors

This project was developed by Ana María Martínez Gómez, Aitor Alonso Lorenzo and Víctor Adolfo Gallego Alcalá. There is some code that we used in our project that was not developed by us.  That code is (as it also is indicated in the author comment of the corresponding files): 

* The keyboard interaction module that was developed by Ali Diouri.
* The clock divisor was developed by our teacher Hortensia Mecha.
* The RAM file was initially developed by our teacher Marcos Sanchez-Elez and then modified by us.
